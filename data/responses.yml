  utter_faq/nlu:
    - text: "Natural Language Understanding (NLU) deals with parsing and understanding human language into a structured format.
      Rasa's NLU engine is defined by an [NLU pipeline](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/tuning-your-model#how-to-choose-a-pipeline) and trained on [NLU training data](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/nlu-training-data).
      Usually, an NLU pipeline will include components for:
        - Intent classification: Interpreting meaning based on predefined intents (Example: “Please send the confirmation to amy@example.com” is a send_confirmation intent with 93% confidence)
        - Entity extraction: Recognizing structured data (Example: amy@example.com is an email)."
  utter_faq/rasa_components:
  - text: "Rasa Open Source is a machine learning framework for automated text and voice-based conversations.
           Rasa Open Source consists of NLU (Natural Language Understanding) and Dialogue Management.
           Rasa X is a tool that helps you build, improve, and deploy AI Assistants that are powered by the Rasa Open Source framework."
  utter_faq/dialogue_management:
    - text: "Dialogue management is responsible for deciding what to do next in a conversation based on the context.
      Rasa Dialogue Management is defined by [policies](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/policies) and trained on
      [stories](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/stories) and [rules](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/rules)"
  utter_faq/rasa_playground:
    - text: "In the [Rasa Playground](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/playground) you can
            build a Rasa prototype entirely online. Once you've built your prototype, you can talk to
            your bot online and download your project to continue developing it locally."
  utter_faq/channels:
  - text: "We have a [comprehensive list of supported connectors](https://rasa.com/docs/core/connectors/),

    - text: "Rasa Open Source is written in Python, but programming is not required to develop an assistant.
      To learn how to create an assistant, check out the [Rasa Masterclass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlAQWbhwqLA).
      There is one place where programming skills come in handy, and that is when implementing
      [custom actions](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/core/actions/#custom-actions). You can create an action server in
      Node.js, .NET, Java, or any other language and define your actions there. For custom actions written in Python,
      we provide a small [Python SDK](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/api/rasa-sdk/#rasa-sdk) to make development even easier."
